# Creating the Code of Conduct Acknowledgment Discussion

## Manual Steps (GitHub Web Interface)

1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/maateen/bangla-web-fonts`
2. Click on the **Discussions** tab
3. Click **New discussion**
4. Choose **General** category
5. Set title: `ðŸ“‹ Code of Conduct Acknowledgment - Please Read and Sign`
6. Copy the content from `.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATES/code-of-conduct-acknowledgment.md`
7. Post the discussion
8. **Pin the discussion** using the pin icon in the discussion options

## Using GitHub CLI (Alternative)

If you have GitHub CLI installed and want to automate this:

```bash
# Create the discussion
gh repo set-default maateen/bangla-web-fonts
gh discussion create \
  --title "ðŸ“‹ Code of Conduct Acknowledgment - Please Read and Sign" \
  --body-file .github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATES/code-of-conduct-acknowledgment.md \
  --category "General"

# Note: You'll still need to manually pin the discussion from the web interface
```

## Expected Outcome

- A pinned discussion where community members can publicly acknowledge the COC
- Increased visibility of community standards
- Central location for COC-related questions and clarifications
- Historical record of community member commitments

## Integration with Other COC Mechanisms

This discussion complements our other COC acknowledgment methods:

- Issue template checkboxes
- Pull request template checkboxes
- Contributors registry signatures
- Welcome bot messages

Together, these create multiple touchpoints ensuring community members understand and commit to our standards.
