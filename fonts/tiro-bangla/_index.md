# Tiro Bangla

[Tiro Bangla](https://www.tiro.com/fonts/tiro-bangla) is an elegant typeface crafted by renowned designers [John Hudson](https://www.tiro.com/team/john-hudson) and [Fiona Ross](https://www.tiro.com/team/fiona-ross), with valuable assistance from [Neelakash Kshetrimayum](https://www.tiro.com/team/neelakash-kshetrimayum). The font's heritage traces back to a typeface specifically designed for the prestigious Murty Classical Library of India book series.

While perfectly suited for traditional literary publishing, Tiro Bangla was developed with contemporary needs in mind, functioning beautifully across both print and digital media. Its design draws inspiration from manuscript traditions, particularly emulating the proportions and texture of handset metal type used by prominent Kolkata publishing houses during the pre-mechanical typography era.

The Open Font License release features expanded character support and introduces a complementary italic variant. Each font includes a Latin subset with diacritics specifically designed for accurate transcription of Indian languages.
